](https://suny-ow-edu.zoom.us/j/4330131817?pwd=OWdjMGd6R0pPZkpvb1hSOEd2WDZhZz09)




My plan is to lecture for the first 30-45 mins of each class session, and then the rest of the time give you time to work through the code in the textbook. I plan to put you in individual breakout rooms, and the circulate from room to room assisting each individual student.

**Office Hours:**

**Course description:** 

A fast-paced introduction to features of Python with an eye toward scientific and data analysis applications. Basic data structures and algorithms, data abstractions, and object-oriented programming. 
Introduction to Python libraries such as Numpy and Pandas, maybe PyTorch. Time permitting, we will introduce additional miscellaneous topics such as deep learning, natural language processing, large language models, etc.


**Course webpage** 

**Course Objectives**: At the end of this course the students will be able to:

-   Use primitive data structures and control flows in Python
-  Perform basic manipulations using Python libraries used in scientific and data analysis applications: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, etc 
    
-   Understand basic concepts behind object oriented design (e.g. encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism) and implement them in Python
    
-   Explain simple examples of searching and sorting algorithms (e.g. bubble sort, insert sort, quicksort)
    
-   Explain basic concepts/techniques in data science and/or machine learning
    

**Textbook:** 

_The Python Workshop_ by Corey Wade, Andrew Bird, et al. Packt Publishing.

(Either the 1st or 2nd edition is fine since they are almost the same; the publisher has a link to the 1st edition here [https://security.packt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/9781839218859-THE_PYTHON_WORKSHOP.pdf](https://security.packt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/9781839218859-THE_PYTHON_WORKSHOP.pdf))

Here is the Github containing the code examples for the book:

The first edition can also be accessed from the SUNY Old Westbury library here:

The pace of the course fairly rapid, each day we cover what in a semester version of the course we would spend a week or more.

*For Algorithms, Data Structures, etc.:*
Leetcode: https://www.leetcode.com
(A bit advanced for this course, but just so you hear about it for later on your studies:)

> On LeetCode, you can use tutorials and study plans to learn fundamental and advanced data structures and algorithms, compete in contests, use guides to prepare for top companies, exercise your problem solving skills by solving real interview questions, and much more.

#### Before the course begins
Before the course starts, I invite you to attempt the following:
- Email me at morey@oldwestbury.edu telling me a bit about your interests, reasons for taking the course, coding background
- install a code editor such as Visual Studio Code
- install Python and pyenv (to manage environments) and Python (any version 3.10+ is fine, for example 3.11.4), as described here:
	- On Windows: [https://youtu.be/HTx18uyyHw8](https://youtu.be/HTx18uyyHw8)
	- On MacOS/Linux: [https://youtu.be/31WU0Dhw4sk](https://youtu.be/31WU0Dhw4sk)

If you experience difficulties with this, do not worry as it is not essential at this point and you can just use for instance Google Colab notebook (https://colab.research.google.com/) for now and figure this out later.

### Class Meetings
**Class meeting times:**  5:50 pm - 8:05 pm MTWR on  Zoom, July 17-August 17

My plan for a typical session is to introduce the material for the first 30-45 mins, and then the rest of the session give you time to work through the code in the textbook. I plan to put you in individual breakout rooms, and then circulate from room to room assisting each individual student.

For various reasons, I have abandoned giving timed written exams, for better or worse. 

**Weekly Videos**
At the end of each week, for weeks 1-4 (the course has 5 weeks), record a video 10-15 min instructional video, aimed towards your classmates, teaching them some things you learned.

**Participation**
You need to attend and be on task for all class sessions. When I visit breakout room, you should be able to share screen and show me a reasonable attempt at engaging with the material.

**Final Exam**
One-on-one oral exam

## Technology requirements
This course is taught remotely and synchronously via Zoom, and nothing beyond a typical internet-connected computer obviously required for any such a course is neccessary.  Specifically, you will need
 - some sort of computer (desktop, laptop) capable of running the following software:
- Zoom
- Python
- Visual Studio Code (or similar editor)
- reliable access to the internet (for synchronous Zoom sessions,  access to Google Colab)



## Academic Integrity

The college's policy on academic integrity also applies to this course
https://www.oldwestbury.edu/policies/academicresearch/policy-academic-integrity
Here are some excerpts from that policy:

>As members of the Old Westbury community, students are expected to adhere to standards of honesty and ethical behavior. Plagiarism and other types of academic dishonesty are condemned at all academic institutions. These acts detract from the student’s intellectual and personal growth by undermining the processes of higher learning and the struggle with one’s own expression of ideas and information.  Good academic procedure requires giving proper credit when using the words or ideas of others.

>Plagiarizing means “presenting somebody else’s words or ideas without acknowledging where those words and ideas come from” (Ann Raimes, Keys for Writers, 7th ed., p.135).  Examples include:
>-   copying material from the Internet or other sources and presenting it as one’s own
>-    using any author’s words without quotation marks; using any quotation without credit
>-   changing any author's words slightly and presenting them as one's own
>-   turning in any assignment containing material written by someone else (including tutor or friend); buying work and submitting it as one's own

Know what plagiarism is and how to avoid it; for guidance see Raimes or any other college writing handbook. 

## Accommodations for students with disabilities
