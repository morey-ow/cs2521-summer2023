**Course description:** 

A fast-paced introduction to features of Python with an eye toward scientific and data analysis applications. Basic data structures and algorithms, data abstractions, and object-oriented programming. 
Introduction to numpy and pandas. Time permitting, we will introduce additional miscellaneous topics such as deep learning, natural language processing, large language models, etc.


**Course webpage** 

**Course Objectives**: At the end of this course the students will be able to:

-   Use primitive data structures and control flows in Python
-  Perform basic manipulations using Python libraries used in scientific and data analysis applications: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, etc 
    
-   Understand basic concepts behind object oriented design (e.g. encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism) and implement them in Python
    
-   Explain simple examples of searching and sorting algorithms (e.g. bubble sort, insert sort, quicksort)
    
-   Explain basic concepts in machine learning (e.g. approximating  function)
    

**Textbook:** 

_The Python Workshop_ by Corey Wade, Andrew Bird, et al.. Packt Publishing.

(Either 1st or 2nd edition is fine since they are almost the same; the publisher has a link to the 1st edition here [https://security.packt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/9781839218859-THE_PYTHON_WORKSHOP.pdf](https://security.packt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/9781839218859-THE_PYTHON_WORKSHOP.pdf))

Here is the Github containing the code examples for the book:

The first edition can also be accessed from the SUNY Old Westbury library here:

The pace of the course fairly rapid, each day we cover what in a semester version of the course we would spend a week or more.

## Before the course begins
Before the course starts, I invite you to attempt the following:
- install a code editor such as Visual Studio Code
- install Python and pyenv (to manage environments) and Python (any version 3.10+ is fine, for example 3.11.4), as described here:
	- On Windows: [https://youtu.be/HTx18uyyHw8](https://youtu.be/HTx18uyyHw8)
	- On MacOS/Linux: [https://youtu.be/31WU0Dhw4sk](https://youtu.be/31WU0Dhw4sk)

If you experience difficulties, do not worry, you can just use for instance Google Colab notebook for now and figure it out later.

## Grading
|               |     |
| -------------: | ------ |
| Homework      | 30  |
| Participation | 10  |
| Exam 1        | 20  |
| Exam 2        | 20  |
| Exam 3         |20|

**Late work IS accepted. You can also resubmit graded work to be regraded (without penalty).** The point is to learn, not gotcha grading. (The only hard deadline is the end of the course August 18, 2022)


I avoid giving timed written exams (unless requested by a student for transfer credit purposes). Instead I have started doing something different - and likely more time consuming and formative - students are given a list of problems and they have to record a video *explaining*  


 If you can convince me that you can understand and explain most of the material, then happy to give you an appropriate grade, e.g. A. 
## Technology requirements
This course is taught remotely and synchronously via Zoom, and nothing beyond a typical internet-connected computer obviously required for any such a course is neccessary.  Specifically, you will need
 - some sort of computer (desktop, laptop) capable of running the following software:
- Zoom
- Python
- Visual Studio Code (or similar editor)
- reliable access to the internet (for synchronous Zoom sessions,  access to Google Colab)

- some way to submit handwritten work (e.g writing on a electronic tablet or  by taking a photo of the paper containing the handwriting and uploading it)



## Academic Integrity

The college's policy on academic integrity also applies to this course
https://www.oldwestbury.edu/policies/academicresearch/policy-academic-integrity
Here are some excerpts from that policy:

>As members of the Old Westbury community, students are expected to adhere to standards of honesty and ethical behavior. Plagiarism and other types of academic dishonesty are condemned at all academic institutions. These acts detract from the student’s intellectual and personal growth by undermining the processes of higher learning and the struggle with one’s own expression of ideas and information.  Good academic procedure requires giving proper credit when using the words or ideas of others.

>Plagiarizing means “presenting somebody else’s words or ideas without acknowledging where those words and ideas come from” (Ann Raimes, Keys for Writers, 7th ed., p.135).  Examples include:
>-   copying material from the Internet or other sources and presenting it as one’s own
>-    using any author’s words without quotation marks; using any quotation without credit
>-   changing any author's words slightly and presenting them as one's own
>-   turning in any assignment containing material written by someone else (including tutor or friend); buying work and submitting it as one's own

Know what plagiarism is and how to avoid it; for guidance see Raimes or any other college writing handbook.
